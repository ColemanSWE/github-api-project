# The Github Grader

This is a project where you can enter your github username and you will be given a random "grade" on your profile.
This is just for fun and harkens back to old Facebook/Myspace quizzes. :)

This app was made using react.js

## Setup (Windows)

This setup guide assumes you have yarn installed on your machine. If you don't have yarn installed you can find instructions [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

to install dependencies. Once you have depencies you can run:

### `yarn start`

To start the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
